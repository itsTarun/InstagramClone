# InstagramClone
This repository contains the source code for an Instagram clone app built with SwiftUI and Firebase. The app allows users to post photos, view photos from other users, and comment on photos. The app is still under development, but it is already functional and can be used to learn about SwiftUI, Firebase, and iOS development.

The app is built using the MVVM architecture, which is a popular design pattern for iOS apps. The app uses Firebase as its backend, which provides a scalable and reliable way to store and manage data.

The app is open source, so anyone can contribute to its development. If you are interested in contributing, please feel free to open a pull request.

I hope you enjoy using this app!
